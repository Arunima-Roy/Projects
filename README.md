# Projects
This is a dedicated space for all the analytics projects that I've done over the years, through school and personal projects that I've picked up on my own. 

Projects:
1) Business Analytics Capstone "Final Report" and "Final Presentation".
In my Master of Science in Business Analytics program, I had a capstone project where my group was partnered with Boeing. Our goal was to predict the chemical consumption over 5 years. My group created a forecasting algorithm based on the data provided by the Boeing Team.
